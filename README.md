> A Simple In-browser simulator of nQueens Algorithm.

> The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other. 

> This project aims at explaining backtracking with the help of nQueens algorithm in a fun and easy-to-understand method.

> To try out go to: [nQueens Simulator](https://nqueens.surge.sh)

### Future Goals
- [ ] Improve CSS and add mobile support.
- [ ] Implement option for Branch and Bound method.
- [ ] Calculating all possible solutions.
- [ ] Add Stats like total time taken, total iterations,etc.
- [ ] Exporting possible solutions in form of png/pdf.
- [ ] Adding a algorithm view like [here](https://visualgo.net/)
- [ ] Distributed computing for very large n.
- [ ] Adding support for, What if k queens are fixed originally? Is a solution possible?
- [ ] Adding more Queens:smile:.
